- Continue DES 325K and OL3 folded control production runs, plotted mdOut for current progress
- Continue WE 2D unfolding RMSD_MinDist - Making excellend progress, need to pull structures at 50 iterations to check 
- Stalling out on Folding RMSD 1D pcoords, folding 2D RMSD_RoG, unfolding 1D RMSD not actually unfolding?
    - Do I continue pushing these or give up? Not sure how to assess what is worth continuing/wasting space on?
- Stripped 5 us trajectory KEEP Na+ Cl- ions
- Worked on organizing thoughts for how to approach DSSR/analyzing eRMSD jump (below) and just setting this thing up 

- Ideas for 5 microsecond DES 300K folded control production run
    - Steve said to determine structural change that occurs between 1.5 to 2 us, where jump from < 0.7 to > 0.7 eRMSD occurs
    - Current frames for analysis:
        - NMR structure from PDB
        - PDB structure run through pdb4amber cleanup
        - Frame 0 of folded control production run
        - Frame 1546000 (eRMSD < 0.7)
        - Frame 1624000 (eRMSD > 0.7)

    - DSSR to analyze structural details, find differences in structures?
        - Take averages from 500 ns prior and post jump, and compare average structural features?
        - How and WHAT to compare between structures to determine main drivers of eRMSD shift? What kinds of plots/visualizations, which datasets to use?
        - How to use trajectories with DSSR and what are the outputs for this? Can you plot information about conformational parameters as time series?
        - How to parse/use .json file for max information?

    - DSSR output includes
        - .json file with all information about every base and it's interactions, classifications, etc. 
        - Hydrogen bond list with distances
        - Secondary structures: .ct, .bpseq, .dbn -- what do any of these mean, how to read?
